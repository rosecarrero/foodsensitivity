    <p> Nutrition is the process of obtaining food which is necessary for health and growth. We digest and absorb about 97% of the food we consume but the absorption is severely restricted when the lining of our intestines becomes irritated. This can occur with food allergies, food intolerances and inflammatory bowel diseases. If these issues are not resolved the nutrient absorption will not occur. Food allergy is an immune system reaction that occurs right after eating certain foods. Lactose intolerance is the inability for a person to digest lactose. Lactose is a sugar found in dairy products. Gluten sensitivity is a condition that causes a person to react after ingesting gluten which is a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. Inflammatory bowl disease is a group of inflammatory conditions of the colon and the small intestine. The most common symptoms are gastrointestinal problems for food allergies, food intolerances and inflammatory bowel diseases.
